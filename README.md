# vexriscv-ulx3s-simple-plugin
A simple custom instruction for the vexriscv, deploy- and debuggable on a ulx3s board.

## Description
You got yourself a ULX3S FPGA Board and want to try out
1. building a Vexriscv from SpinalHDL.
2. including a custom instruction for the Vexriscv.
3. generate the bitstream for the ULX3S.
4. upload the bitstream to the ULX3S.
5. build a C-Project to test the custom instruction.
6. upload the ELF-file via an Openocd-Debugger and GDB.
7. seeing the UART output in a console.

That all is include in this Repository.

## Prerequisites
You will need:
1. The neccessary tools are contained in this Virtual Machine (VM):
[Virtual Machine](https://random-oracles.org/risc-v/)
Download the VM and follow the documentation for starting it up.
2. An ULX3S FPGA Board (85k Version):
[Radiona ULX3S](https://radiona.org/ulx3s/)
3. A JTAG Adapter (TF232H) from Adafruit:
[Adafruit TF2323H](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264)
